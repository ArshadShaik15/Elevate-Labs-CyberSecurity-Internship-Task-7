### Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

<br>


### 🎯 Objective:<br>

<p align="left">To identify, assess the risk of, and remove potentially malicious or unnecessary browser extensions from my primary web browser, thereby improving browser security and user privacy.</p><br>


### 💻 Lab Setup:<br>

• Google Chrome (or) Microsoft Edge<br>
• Browser's native Extensions Manager (`chrome://extensions`)<br>
• Google Search and Chrome/Firefox Extension Store for research<br>
<br>
<br>

### Process:<br>

<br>
<strong>1. Access:</strong><p align="left">Navigated to the extensions manager page on all active browsers.</p>
<br>
<strong>2. Review:</strong><p align="left">Performed a comprehensive audit of all installed extensions, checking the developer, user count, and recent reviews.</p>
<br>
<strong>3. Permission Analysis:</strong><p align="left">Critically examined the <strong>permissions</strong> requested by each extension, flagging any that requested broad data access (e.g.,"read and change all data on all websites") without a clear, necessary justification.</p>

<br>
<strong>4. Action:</strong><p align="left">Disabled or removed unused/suspicious extensions</p>
<br>
<strong>5. Verification:</strong><p align="left">Restarted the browser and confirmed stability and performance.</p>
<br>
<br>

### Suspicious/Removed Extensions:<br>

All installed extensions were verified as necessary, legitimate, and from trusted sources.

| Extension Name | Suspicious | Action Taken (Removed/Disabled) | Primary Reason for Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enhancer for Youtube** | No | Removed | Inactive/Not Needed |
| **Copy-n-Paste: Clipboard Upload Simplified** | No | Removed | Inactive/Note Needed |
| **Go Full Page - Full Page Screen Capture** | No | Removed | Inactive/Not Needed |
| **Merlin - Ask AI to Research, Write & Review** | No | Removed | Inactive/Not Needed |
| **Secure Exam Proctor** | No | Removed | Not Needed |
<br>
<br>

### Summary:<br>

<p align="left">The goal was to <strong>Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions</strong> by performing an audit of my installed browser add-ons. The key finding was that all five named extensions, including the one-time-use Secure Exam Proctor, were either inactive or no longer needed for their original purpose. The recommendation was the immediate removal of all unused extensions specifically, <strong>Secure Exam Proctor, Enhancer for YouTube, Copy-n-Paste: Clipboard Upload Simplified, Merlin - Ask AI to Research, Write & Review, and Go Full Page - Full Page Screen Capture.</strong> This proactive step successfully completes the task by eliminating unnecessary software and reducing the "attack surface" of my browser.</p><br>
<br>

Conclusion:<br>

<p align="left">While i removed these extensions because they were unused, it is important to note that any unnecessary extension poses an inherent risk. The core security strategy is the Principle of Least Privilege: minimize the number of installed extensions to only those you absolutely require. This limits the total amount of third-party code running in your browser, which is the key to minimizing security risks. For long-term safety, implement a Quarterly Security Audit to remove any extension you haven't actively used in the last few months. Always scrutinize permissions before installing, as extensions that ask for excessive access (like reading all website data) unnecessarily increase your exposure. For sensitive activities, use a dedicated, extension-free browser profile to completely isolate high-value data from all third-party code.</p><br>
